# EduAppForYoungWomen
Project for virtual hackathon Technica 2020!

# Goal
Our goal was to create a web application that helps young girls and women learn more about their bodies - particularly menstruation! We hope that by sharing the information and resources they need, young girls and women will feel more confident  themselves and their bodies.
